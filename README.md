TODO

Simple Django web application for managing tasks.

This project is a basic todo list built with Django using classic MVT architecture and HTML templates. It implements CRUD operations for tasks and is intended as a small pet project to practice backend development with Django.
The application uses SQLite as a default database and runs with Django development server. No external services are required.
To run the project locally, clone the repository, create a virtual environment, install Django, apply migrations and start the server using 
python manage.py runserver
